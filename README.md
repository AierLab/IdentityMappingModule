# Identity Mapping Module

ðŸš§ **This Repository is Under Construction** ðŸš§

## Overview
The **Identity Mapping Module** is a work-in-progress project focused on implementing **identity initialization** for deep learning models. By initializing models layer-by-layer with identity mappings, the project aims to enhance training stability, efficiency, and performance in complex neural networks.

## Features (Planned)
- Identity initialization for all model layers.
- Compatibility with popular architectures like ResNet and Transformer-based models.
- Tools for experimenting with initialization methods based on information theory.
- Frameworks for testing on tasks like image inpainting and data compression while maintaining consistent information levels between input and output.

## Objectives
1. **Streamline Training**: Simplify the training of increasingly complex models by employing better initialization strategies.
2. **Information-Theoretic Insights**: Explore how initialization influences the flow of information during training.
3. **Cross-Task Generalization**: Validate the approach on multiple machine learning tasks to prove its versatility.

## Current Status
This repository is still in the early development phase. Key components such as the implementation of identity-based initialization and experimental pipelines are under active construction.
